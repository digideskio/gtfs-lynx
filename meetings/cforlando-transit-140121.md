# Code for Orlando / Transit

January 21, 2014
~1:45pm - 2:45pm
Downtown Credo

Discussing possibilities for creating physical and/or digital maps incorporating public transportation (LYNX, LYMMO, SunRail), cycling and walking, with a focus on Downtown Orlando and surrounding neighborhoods.

## Notes

Lynx map is too geographically broad.

Certain parts of map have too much overlap and look complicated. On orange ave all I want to know is when the next bus is, there are lots of overlaps.

Looks cumbersome, difficult, prob doesn't go where I want it to.
Google maps is built in a way that assumes walking, and also doesn't combine biking route with lynx, and also wouldn't transfer you with a one mile route.

Lynx individual route maps are very obscure.

Target market for this discussion? Young urban professionals / creative class. Not using it because it's clunky, we want to ease the on ramp. Also geographic discussion: those living near downtown / satellite neighborhoods of downtown. Untapped market.

How does it relate to creative village.

Lymmo stops running before bob Carr show gets out.

What medium?

Matt's custom google map. Thickness corresponding to frequency. Overlapping routes. E.g. 13 and 15 downtown circular. Semoran to OBT, Fairbanks to Michigan.

Printed materials at condos, businesses? Places like credo could be good way to roll out.

Interview series? David Moran, Brian Wilson rely on bus.

What's walkable from here? Wayfinding signage. Walkyourcity.org

Guerrilla bus stop schedules
Geolocation website to see schedule. I have a bike.

Connecting bus stops to bike trails

Lynx, lymmo, urban trail, Gertrude's walk.

Public art in Orlando walking tour.

Maps at featured locations. At credo: you can get here from ... And from here you can get to ...

Map needs to be simple to be usable.

Also what about sun rail? How does that connect in?

Street names vs location names pros and cons

Underlying transit map for area
Where can you get to within a certain time period
How to provide the best way to get from point a to b

Can google maps do more with better data? What about other transit / routing maps?

Is lymmo in google maps?
Will sunrail be in google maps?

New lymmo routes coming ... Thornton park to citrus bowl (east west tangerine line), and parramore / amway / creative village

GitHub repo for sharing. Make new username: codefororlando. May already exist.

Survey to determine hotspot destinations. Or build into a web frontend and track the data over time

Include google API research

Google translate audio recording?

Gamify transport, leaderboard for how much time spent on bus, walking, driving. Create challenges, urban mobile games.
