# GTFS

(todo: add some background info and links on GTFS and the GTFS data exchange)

Currently, LYNX does not provide an up to date public feed of GTFS data, but you can request GTFS data from their GIS department. You may also be interested in the [LYNX GIS Data Download Page](http://www.golynx.com/lynxmap/DataDownload/index.htm).

We will periodically post LYNX GTFS data in this repository for the purpose of experimentation. Please read the disclaimer in the [lynx](lynx) directory and distribute / display it with any use of the data.
